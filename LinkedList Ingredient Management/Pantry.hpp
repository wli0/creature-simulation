            Name: A string
            Description: A string
            Quantity: A non negative integer
            Price: A non negative integer
            Recipe: A list of Ingredient titles of the form [NAME1] [NAME2];
            For example, to make this ingredient, you need (Ingredient 1 AND Ingredient 2)
            The value may be NONE.
        Notes:
            - The first line of the input file is a header and should be ignored.
            - The recipe are separated by a semicolon and may be NONE.
            - The recipe may be in any order.
            - If any of the recipe are not in the list, they should be created as new ingredients with the following information:
                - Title: The name of the ingredient
                - Description: "UNKNOWN"
                - Quantity: 0
                - Recipe: An empty vector
            - However, if you eventually encounter a ingredient that matches one of the "UNKNOWN" ingredients while parsing the file, you should update all the ingredient details.
            
            For example, given a row in the file:
            Inferno_Espresso,An energizing elixir brewed with mystical flames providing resistance to caffeine crashes for a limited time.,1,50,Fiery_Bean Ember_Spice

            The order of the ingredients in the list:
            Fiery_Bean, Ember_Spice, Inferno_Espresso
            Hint: update as needed using addIngredient()
            
        @post: Each line of the input file corresponds to a ingredient to be added to the list. No duplicates are allowed.
